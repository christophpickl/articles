# Articles

An (electron) desktop application to manage (tagged) articles locally.

# Roadmap

* [2] created/updated at timestamp; require data model versioning
* [3] nicer UI (bigger window, colors)
    * mehr vgap form and list
    * set focus on app load on title input field
* [7] live autocomplete suggestion combox for tags
* ad tags summary: group by, count displayen
* FANCY: in-line editor, when click on article (don't jump to form at top!)
* FANCY: delete button which appears when hover over some part of an article (far right, just slightly indicated)


# Notes

- keine max length beschraenkung
- mit SHIFT+click auf tag: reset search to only this tag
- after hit create, immediately be in "create mode" again
- make top tag list clickable!
- sort all tags (by number of occurence OR alphabetically)
- change view mode: compact only seeing list of titles (sorted alphabetically?!)
- back office:
	* tags related to each other
	* articles link with each other
	=> increased search suggestions / network (afterwards with point system)
