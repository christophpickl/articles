# Articles

An (electron) desktop application to manage (tagged) articles locally.

# Roadmap

* listen CMD+F to search
* [2] created/updated at timestamp; require data model versioning
* [3] nicer UI (bigger window, colors)
    * mehr vgap form and list
    * set focus on app load on title input field
* [3] list of top/all tags (meta tags: "golden")
* [2] clickable tag => filter for this tag
* [7] live autocomplete suggestion combox for tags

fancy UI:

* in-line editor, when click on article (don't jump to form at top!)
* delete button which appears when hover over some part of an article (far right, just slightly indicated)
