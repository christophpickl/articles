## Later
* [8] auto backup functionality
* [3] nicer UI (bigger window, colors)
    * mehr vgap form and list
    * set focus on app load on title input field

## Luxury

* [7] live autocomplete suggestion combox for tags
* FANCY: in-line editor, when click on article (don't jump to form at top!)
* FANCY: delete button which appears when hover over some part of an article (far right, just slightly indicated)
- sort all tags (by number of occurence OR alphabetically)
- change view mode: compact only seeing list of titles (sorted alphabetically?!)
- back office:
	* tags related to each other
	* articles link with each other
	=> increased search suggestions / network (afterwards with point system)
